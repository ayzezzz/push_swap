Push_swap is a project focused on sorting algorithms and stack-based data structure manipulation. The goal is to sort a list of integers with the fewest moves possible, using only two stacks (A and B) and a limited set of predefined operations. This project emphasizes algorithmic efficiency, challenging users to implement optimized sorting techniques within a constrained environment.
